# Add two numbers

# Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
# Prompt the user to enter the second number.
# Read the input and convert it to an integer.
# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.

# Solution:

First = int(input("Enter the First Number :"))
Second = int(input("Enter the Second Number :"))

print("The Sum of first number and second number ", First + Second)
