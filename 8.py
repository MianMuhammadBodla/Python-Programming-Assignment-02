# Pop method You have a list named items with the elements [10, 20, 30, 40]. If you use the pop method without any arguments, what will the list look like and what value will be removed?

# Solution:


list = [10, 20, 30, 40]

removed_list = list.pop()

print(f"Removed item: {removed_list}")


print(f"List after pop: {list}")
